regional control after radiation therapy , especially in head and neck cancers , may be compromised by anemia.24 anemia often worsens symptoms such as fatigue , weakness , and dyspnea , and thus may have a negative effect on quality of life ( qol ) and performance status in patients with cancer . \\n thus , to improve physical functioning , qol , and prognosis in patients with cancer , it would be reasonable to take a proactive approach in identifying populations who need treatment for cancer - associated anemia ( caa ) and provide timely management . \\n blood transfusion is an effective way to replace depleted hb within a short period , but the effect is , unfortunately , temporary and can cause serious adverse risks and increased mortality . in randomized clinical trials in patients with caa \\n , erythropoiesis - stimulating agents ( esas ) produced significant increases in hb level , decreased transfusion requirements , and improved qol.57 however , 30%50% of patients do not respond to such agents . \\n in addition , the use of esas often causes concern about severe adverse reactions.6,8 in several studies , esas were found to shorten overall survival time , or time to tumor progression in patients whose hb level reached more than 12 g / dl . \\n these studies included patients with different primary cancers , such as breast , lung , head and neck , cervix , and lymphomas.911 the lack of response to erythropoietin stimulation in patients with cancer is partly attributed to the functional iron deficiency state , in which the high rate of erythropoiesis exceeds the delivery of usable iron , despite adequate iron stores.12 absolute iron deficiency , in contrast , occurs when iron delivery is impaired because iron stores are depleted ( serum ferritin , < 100 ng / ml ; transferring saturation , < 20%).13 hepcidin , a peptide hormone produced by the liver , is up - regulated in chronic inflammatory states including cancer . \\n hepcidin inhibits iron transport across cell membranes , thus decreasing the accessibility of stored iron and gastrointestinal absorption of dietary iron , leading to an increased frequency of iron - restricted erythropoiesis.1416 many randomized trials examined the role of intravenous ( iv ) iron in addition to esas in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer . \\n many of these studies showed improvement in esa response , time to maximal response , reduction in esa dose , and improvement in qol parameters ( when measured ) in favor of the combination over esas alone . \\n the observed benefit was independent of baseline iron parameters.1721 one study found a 36% reduction in the number of patients transfused.21 this pilot study assessed the efficacy and feasibility of iv iron monotherapy in patients with cancer who have anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy without the use of esas . \\n patients received the study treatment for 12 weeks followed by a 4-week follow - up period . \\n eligible patients were at least 18 years old , about to start a cycle of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 1 week of inclusion , and had a nonmyeloid malignancy , hb levels of 11.0 g / dl or less , a life expectancy of more than 24 weeks , and an eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 02 . \\n patients were also required to have a serum ferritin level of 100 ng / ml or higher or transferrin saturation ( tsat ) levels of 15% or higher and to have received no esas or iv iron therapy within 30 days and no oral iron therapy ( 27 mg / day or more ) within 7 days before enrollment . \\n patients were excluded for leukoerythroblastic features on blood film , hemolysis , gastrointestinal bleeding , folate or vitamin b12 deficiency , elevated serum ferritin ( 900 ng / ml ) or transferrin saturation ( tsat ) ( 35% ) levels , pregnancy or lactation , liver dysfunction ( grade 2 or higher based on national cancer institute common toxicity criteria ) , renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine levels 2.0 mg / dl ) , active infection requiring systemic antibiotics , personal or family history of hemochromatosis , comorbidities precluding study participation , hypersensitivity to iv iron , red blood cell transfusion within the last 2 weeks , or any investigational agent within 30 days before enrollment . \\n patients were not allowed to take any vitamin , mineral , or herbal supplements containing 27 mg or more of iron per day or 100 mg vitamin c per day during the study or follow -

test . a significance criterion of p < 0.05 was used in the analysis . \\n all analyses were performed using sas version 9.1 ( sas institute inc , cary , nc , usa ) . \\n twenty - five patients ( 17 women and 8 men ) were eligible , consented , and included in the study ; their mean age ( standard deviation , [ sd ] ) was 56 years ( 13.0 years ) . \\n chemotherapy varied according to the primary cancer and included anthracycline , platinum , taxanes , cyclophosphamide , high - dose ifosfamide , vincristine , vinblastine , bleomycin , and others . \\n many of the included patients had their chemotherapy treatment as second- or third - line therapy . \\n patients characteristics , including age , primary tumor , and active anticancer treatment are summarized in table 1 . \\n one patient died during the study from his tumor ( after week 2 ) , and five patients withdrew from the study because of inconvenience ( three after week 3 , and two after week 4 ) . \\n nineteen ( 76.0% ) patients completed a minimum of three treatments , 15 ( 60.0% ) completed nine treatments , and 14 ( 56.0% ) completed all twelve planned weekly treatments . \\n as seen in table 2 , the mean hb level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g / dl ( median , 9.9 g / dl ; range , 6.9 g / dl10.9 g / dl ) . for the 15 patients who completed at least nine treatments , the mean change in their hb level was 1.7 g / dl ( median , 1.1 g / dl ; range , 1.9 g / dl to 3.2 g / dl ) . \\n for the 14 patients who completed the whole treatment period ( 12 weeks ) , the mean hb level change was 2.1 g / dl ( median , 1.3 g / dl ; range , 0.2 g / dl to 4.6 g / dl ; p = 0.0007 ) . \\n eight ( 42.1% ) of the 19 patients who completed at least three iron infusions had a more than 1 g / dl increase in their hb level . \\n hemoglobin level changes for the 14 patients who completed twelve iron infusions are shown in figure 1 . \\n no iv iron - related adverse events were reported among patients during the study or the follow - up period . \\n tsat was monitored during the study period , and no patients had tsat levels increase to more than 50% . \\n the highest ferritin level among patients who completed at least nine iv iron treatments was 1,170 ng / ml ; the mean level at the end of study period for the whole group was 379 ng / ml . \\n five ( 20.0% ) patients received blood transfusions and were considered treatment failures ( three after week 3 , transfused at hb levels of 6.9 g / dl , 7.8 g / dl , and 5.4 g / dl ; one after week 4 , transfused at an hb level of 8.2 g / dl ; and one after week 9 , transfused at an hb level of 7.2 g / dl ) . \\n low hb levels are associated with diminished qol and possibly decreased overall survival.2 successful treatment of anemia has undeniable benefits for patients , often yielding dramatic symptomatic improvement . \\n although the role of esas is well - established in treating caa , big concerns were recently raised about the negative effect of esas on survival in some patients with cancer.911 concerns about the risk for thromboembolism in patients with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.22,23 in addition , the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24 , 25 in our pilot study , we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion , which could be a valid alternative , especially for patients with curable cancers . \\n oral iron is easier to administer and relatively inexpensive , but low patient adherence , poor enteral absorption , and poor tolerance because of a wide range of troublesome gastrointestinal adverse effects limit its overall effectiveness.26 anemia of chronic disease may occur in patients with cancer and is associated with an increase in hepcidin levels , which decreases oral iron absorption and bone marrow iron use , negating any possible effect of regular doses of oral iron.15 iv iron therapy significantly improves response to epoetin alfa when compared with oral iron or no iron in anemic patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.1721 oral iron supplements with esas showed no significant benefit over esas alone in treating caa.21 sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose appear to have more favorable safety profiles over iron dextran . \\n a large prospective safety comparison trial failed to show serious anaphylactoid reactions,27 which is confirmed in our study , in which no patients developed reactions and no patients withdrew from the study because of adverse effects . given that the mean hb increase using esas with iv iron in one large controlled trial was 2.4 g / dl,21 the results obtained in our study are clinically significant . \\n these findings should be further confirmed and better assessed in larger studies , in which questions such as the optimal timing of iv iron therapy with respect to chemotherapy and the optimal total dose of iv iron should be determined . \\n the use of iv iron monotherapy was recently reviewed by a group in germany that studied the use of ferric carboxymaltose to replace esa and blood transfusions as a treatment for caa . \\n iron - deficient patients treated with ferric carboxymaltose alone ( n = 233 ) had a median of 1.4 g / dl increase in hemoglobin levels compared with those receiving additional treatment with esas ( n = 46 ; median , 1.6 g / dl ) . our study , \\n however , is peculiar in using iron therapy in a non - iron - deficiency state.28 iron overload after iv iron therapy , with potential concerns about the risk of developing secondary cancers and infection , might be raised . \\n the highest serum ferritin level in the present study in patients who completed at least 9 weeks of iv iron therapy was 1,170 ng / ml . most of the literature addressing cancer and infections in iron - overloaded patients comes from patients with hemochromatosis or patients who are undergoing hemodialysis . \\n published reviews report an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma only in patients with hemochromatosis after they develop cirrhosis.29 similarly data supporting the association between iv iron therapy and higher infection rate are weak and not well - supported.30 in fact , anemia itself is a risk factor for infections in patients receiving hemodialysis.31 a multivariate analysis of associations between iron and mortality in more than 58,000 patients receiving hemodialysis reported no increased death rate from serum ferritin levels as high as 1,200 ng / ml.30 the increasing cost of therapy in patients with cancer is of grave concern , which could be an additional benefit of iv iron over the use of esas in such patients . to further address many of the questions raised , \\n our team is planning a bigger trial for iv iron in patients with cancer who have anemia to confirm the results discussed in this pilot trial . \\n in addition , we will be looking into predictors of response to iv iron , such as serum hepcidin level . \\n iv iron therapy alone is safe and may be effective in improving hb levels in patients with cancer who are undergoing active anticancer therapy . \\n further randomized trials are needed to address many of the questions raised in our pilot study .\",\n          \"syncope is caused by transient diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion and is characterized by transient loss of consciousness with a rapid onset followed by spontaneous and complete recovery . \\n clinical features of syncope may include myoclonic jerks which are often multifocal and asynchronous , convulsions , and urinary incontinence , making it difficult to differentiate from epileptic seizure by clinical features alone . \\n significant fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure are prevented by autoregulation of cerebral circulation , but there may be conditions where such mechanism may not compensate adequately . \\n cough syncope , a rare form of syncope , may be a result of transient failure of the cerebral autoregulatory mechanism to cope with sudden decrease in cerebral blood flow . \\n we present an unusual case of recurrent cough syncope , which was initially diagnosed and treated as seizures , in the context of a left - sided glomus jugulare tumor , a benign paraganglioma . \\n a 43-year - old right - handed woman with history of glomus jugulare tumor in the left jugular fossa with intracranial extension into the posterior cranial fossa was transferred from another hospital for recurrent seizure - like spells . \\n she had a 90% surgical resection of the tumor done in 2011 followed by radiation therapy in september 2012 . \\n her episodes occurred multiple times a day ( 7 per day on average ) during wakeful state . \\n they were triggered by coughing ( usually a bout of cough ) and were characterized by staring and unresponsiveness as well as stiffening of the body with mild shaking of both upper extremities . \\n she was diagnosed with epileptic seizures but continued to have episodes during treatment with the antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) phenytoin , levetiracetam , and lamotrigine . \\n escalation of aed therapy made her increasingly drowsy , and she was on all three aforementioned aeds at the time of presentation . \\n her physical examination was remarkable for excessive drowsiness , mild dysarthria , right sixth cranial nerve palsy , mild hypertonia with hyperreflexia in the lower extremities ( left more than right ) , and bilateral ( left more than right ) ankle clonus . \\n she had a lumbar puncture done at the outside hospital , and the opening cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) pressure was reported to be 25  cm . \\n blood work was also unremarkable except for mild anemia ( hemoglobin : 9.4  g / dl ) , mild hyponatremia ( 132  meq / l ) , and mild hypokalemia ( 3.1  meq / l ) . \\n antiepileptic drug levels were within therapeutic range ( free phenytoin : 1.3  g / ml , levetiracetam : 5.9  g / ml , and lamotrigine : 2.3  g / ml ) . \\n all started with a bout of cough when the patient was lying in bed ( in supine or in lateral position ) which was followed by brief ( less than a minute ) distal upper extremity tremor and subtle proximal upper extremity myoclonic jerks and prolonged unresponsiveness for up to 10  min . \\n all of these episodes were associated with hypotension ( 7278/3147  mm of hg as revealed by continuous arterial pressure monitoring ) and bradycardia ( 5459  bpm ) . \\n the eeg during the spells was characterized by generalized synchronous and asynchronous high amplitude 1- to 2-hz delta activity which progressed to generalized attenuation and then transitioned to generalized delta activity again with recovery ( fig .  1 ) . \\n a head ct showed recurrence of the glomus jugulare tumor and communicating hydrocephalus . an external ventricular drain ( evd ) \\n after placement of the evd , her drowsiness gradually started to improve , and episodes decreased in frequency to one per day . \\n 3 showed an enhancing t2 hyperintense left skull base mass in the region of the left jugular foramen with extension into the posterior cranial fossa and below the base of the skull . \\n brain imaging showed evidence of hydrocephalus that had increased compared with her previous brain imaging done 2  months back . \\n her mental status continued to improve , and she had only one mild episode triggered by cough during the next two days before her discharge . \\n repeat surgical resection of the tumor was recommended by the otolaryngology team , which the patient declined . \\n based on the clinical features and eeg findings , the episodes observed in our patient are most consistent with cough syncope . \\n the mechanism underlying cough syncope is not definitively established , but it is postulated that coughing increases intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures leading to a transient increase in icp . increased icp , in turn , causes a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure which , if it drops below a critical level , may result in global cerebral hypoperfusion leading to syncope . \\n transient cerebral circulatory arrest has been demonstrated by transcranial doppler measurements during cough syncope . our patient also had a drop in blood pressure and heart rate but probably not sufficient to cause syncope by itself . \\n cough syncope has been associated with posterior fossa mass lesions or tonsillar herniation and with hydrocephalus . \\n it may be speculated that bouts of cough caused transient herniation of cerebellar tonsils obstructing csf flow that further contributed to the increase in icp during coughing . \\n decrease in frequency of events following placement of evd to relieve icp lends support to this notion . \\n paragangliomas are rare tumors of extraadrenal chromaffin cell origin that most commonly occur in the head and neck region . \\n catecholamine - hypersecreting paraganglionomas are uncommon in the head and neck region , and most patients ( 95% ) with hypersecreting paraganglionomas have hypertension . \\n hypotension accompanying syncope observed in our patient was not orthostasis - related ( the patient was always supine during spells ) and was most likely related to cough . \\n identified a subset of patients with cough syncope who lacked a blood pressure overshoot ( expected response ) after the relief of straining during valsalva maneuver . \\n the authors postulate that cough syncope in these patients might be the result of delayed recovery from hypotension that follows a paroxysm of cough , and this was likely contributing to global cerebral hypoperfusion in our patient . \\n this case highlights the fact that cough syncope , a rare form of syncope , may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough . \\n glomus caroticum tumor presenting as recurrent unexplained syncope   and posterior fossa meningioma presenting as recurrent cough syncope   have been described . \\n recurrent cough syncope should trigger search for factors , including brain tumors , with the potential to cause transient elevation in icp . \\n this case also illustrates an important role for ceeg monitoring with video in distinguishing syncope from seizures in cough syncope cases . \\n \",\n          \"tardive dystonia ( td ) , a rarer side effect after longer exposure to antipsychotics , is characterized by local or general , sustained , involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle group , with twisting movements , generally slow , which may affect the limbs , trunk , neck , or face . \\n td has been shown to develop in about 3% of patients who have had long - term exposure to antipsychotics . \\n . the low risk of td for atypical antipsychotics is thought to result from their weak affinity for dopamine receptors . compared with typical , \\n atypical antipsychotic agents have a greater affinity for serotonin 5-ht2a than dopamine d2 receptors , with a low propensity to induce td . among this olanzapine \\n is thought to have preferential action at mesolimbic over nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways and is , therefore , associated with a very low incidence of extrapyramidal symptom ( eps ) . \\n furthermore , a retrospective analysis of controlled multicentric trials suggested that olanzapine also improves preexisting symptoms of tardive movements . \\n we report a case of 20-year - old male , belonging to lower socioeconomic class , educated up to 2 standard , presented with severe unilateral dystonic left sided neck movements [ figure 1 ] . \\n careful history exploration revealed he was taking risperidone 2 mg irregularly for 2 months and then olanzapine 5 mg for another 4 months . \\n picture of neck dystonia of patient at 19 years , the patient presented with occasional anger outbursts , getting provoked on small matters and beating family members , running away from home , screaming episodes occasionally , fearfulness , sleep disturbance for 2 days ; which was precipitated after fever . according to the mother \\n , one friend might have threatened / made fun of him actually and after that patient stopped going out of house , and displayed above mentioned symptoms . \\n this was interpreted as psychosis with persecutory ideas , and he was treated with risperidone 2 mg / day for 2 months and then with olanzapine 5 mg / day for 4 months . in last two follow - ups patient did not present himself , and mother reported unusual neck movements , which were taken as a part of his overall psychopathology and not taken seriously , slight intermittent neck movements reported were missed as part of adolescent behavior problems mimicking some hero in movies . as neck dystonia increased , the patient had a severe disability as patient had to keep his hands behind his head for the support . \\n the movement would decrease when the patient was lying down and was absent during sleep . \\n he even stopped taking food due to severe neck movements making chewing and swallowing difficult . \\n his birth and early developmental milestones were normal . during 210 years of age patient was inattentive and mildly hyperactive . \\n other siblings were educated with master 's degree , and patient was also sent to school , but due to inattention and restlessness , he did not pass 2 standard after three attempts . \\n he left the schooling . with average executive functioning and life skills , he worked as an unskilled laborer in the neighborhood shops as a helping hand . \\n , he was found to be getting over familiar , cheerful , moody , and short tempered . \\n sometimes , the patient had inappropriate social judgment ; for which his friends made fun of him , and teased him . on mental status assessment , \\n routine investigations , thyroid function tests , electroencephalogram , fundus examination , cervical x - ray , magnetic resonance imaging brain were normal . after consulting neurophysician , wilson 's disease and other secondary causes of dystonia were ruled out . \\n the patient was treated with clonazepam 1 mg total dissolved solid ( tds ) , tetrabenazine 25 mg tds , trihexiphenidyl 2 mg bipolar disorder ( bd ) . after 2 months , there was some improvement of around 30% . \\n baclofen 10 mg was added ; increased up to 20 mg , trihexyphenidyl reduced to 2 mg . with little improvement after 4 months of treatment for dystonia , levodopa + carbidopa ( 100 + 25 ) was added by neurophysician and increased up to  tablet tds and baclofen omitted . \\n after 12 months of treatment , patient has improved around 90% with tetrabenazine 75 mg , levodopa + carbidopa ( 100 + 25 ) -

iron - deficiency anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy without the use of erythropoiesis - stimulating agents.methodsadult patients with solid cancers and non - iron - deficiency anemia were included . \\n ferric sucrose at a dose of 200 mg was given in short intravenous infusions weekly for a total of 12 weeks . \\n hemoglobin level was measured at baseline , every 3 weeks , and 2 weeks after the last iron infusion ( week 14 ) . \\n adverse events related to intravenous iron were prospectively reported.resultsof 25 patients included , 19 ( 76.0% ) completed at least three iron infusions and 14 ( 56.0% ) finished the planned 12 weeks of therapy . \\n the mean hemoglobin level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g / dl ( median , 9.9 g / dl ; range , 6.9 g / dl 10.9 g / dl ) . the mean change in hemoglobin level for the 15 patients who completed at least 9 treatments was 1.7 g / dl ( median , 1.1 g / dl ; range , 1.9 g / dl to 3.2 g / dl ) ; it reached 2.1 g / dl ( median , 1.3 g / dl ; range , 0.2 g / dl to 4.6 g / dl ; p = 0.0007 ) for the 14 patients who completed all 12 weekly treatments . \\n five ( 20.0% ) patients were transfused and considered as treatment failures . \\n no treatment -

old woman , which was initially thought to be seizures . \\n syncopal episodes were triggered by paroxysms of cough and were characterized by unresponsiveness and myoclonic jerks in her extremities . \\n she had a left - sided glomus jugulare tumor that extended into the posterior cranial fossa with evidence of worsening communicating hydrocephalus on brain imaging . \\n we postulate that bouts of cough produced increased intracranial pressure both by raising intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures as well as by transient obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow secondary to intermittent tonsillar herniation during cough . \\n this resulted in diffuse decrease in cerebral blood flow causing syncope . \\n the patient 's syncopal episodes decreased in frequency once an external ventricular drain was placed followed by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt . \\n search for factors that can increase intracranial pressure seems warranted in patients with recurrent cough syncope .\",\n          \"tardive dystonia ( td ) is a serious side effect of antipsychotic medications , more with typical antipsychotics , that is potentially irreversible in affected patients . \\n studies show that newer atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of td . as a result , many clinicians may have developed a false sense of security when prescribing these medications . \\n we report a case of 20-year - old male with hyperthymic temperament and borderline intellectual functioning , who developed severe td after low dose short duration exposure to atypical antipsychotic risperidone and then olanzapine . \\n the goal of this paper is to alert the reader to be judicious and cautious before using casual low dose second generation antipsychotics in patient with no core psychotic features , hyperthymic temperament , or borderline intellectual functioning suggestive of organic brain damage , who are more prone to develop adverse effects such as td and monitor the onset of td in patients taking atypical antipsychotics .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

by progressive airflow limitation that is partially reversible.1 the global burden of disease studies found that copd was the sixth commonest cause of death worldwide in 1990 but made the alarming prediction that it could become the third commonest cause of death by 2020 irrespective of public health intervention . \\n furthermore , copd was recognized as being the 12th greatest cause of chronic morbidity , with a predicted increase to become the fourth most important disability - producing illness by 2020.24 the assessment of health status has become an increasingly important outcome measure for copd . \\n this includes collecting information on daily symptoms , activity limitation , and other manifestations of the disease . \\n routine clinical evaluations and a critical step in management are to obtain reliable and valid information on the impact of the disease on their health status obtained from the patients themselves . \\n health status measurements such as that provided by st george s respiratory questionnaire ( sgrq ) and the chronic respiratory questionnaire ( crq ) have provided well - validated measurements of disability and handicap due to copd , but these are complex to administer and score in routine clinical practice.5,6 the copd assessment test ( cat ) with a target number of eight items was proven to have good measurement properties and validity for several english speaking countries.7 cat was easy to complete , interpret , and could be readily incorporated into routine care for quality - of - life evaluation of copd patients . \\n the eight items included in the test are cough , phlegm , chest tightness , breathlessness , activity limitation , confidence , sleep , and energy . \\n they were divided into three domains : symptoms ( cough , phlegm , chest tightness ) , physical activities ( breathlessness , activity limitation ) , and impacts ( confidence , sleep , energy ) . \\n items were formatted as a semantic differential 6-point scale and defined by contrasting adjectives.7 the range of cat score is 040 . \\n similar to other countries in the world , several regional dialects are used for communication in different regions of thailand . \\n cultural , language , and communication barriers  singly or in combination  can give rise to mutual misinterpretation between patients and health care providers . \\n most copd patients living in northern thailand are elderly people who are more familiar with the northern thai dialect than thai language and use the former in their daily communication . \\n based on this fact , we initiated this study to determine the more appropriate versions to build the cat questionnaire that could be applied to copd patients living in the northern part of thailand . \\n all subjects were recruited from the outpatient chest clinic of chiang mai university hospital , chiang mai , thailand between october 2010 and december 2010 . \\n this study was approved by the research ethics committee , faculty of medicine , chiang mai university , and written informed consents were obtained from all patients . \\n the inclusion criteria were copd patients with post - bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second ( fev1 ) to force vital capacity ( fvc ) ( < 0.7 in accordance with the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease ( gold),8 smokers or ex - smokers with a smoking history > 10-pack years , age > 40 years , onset of symptoms > 40 years , and without a history of acute exacerbation for at least 3 months prior to enrollment . \\n the exclusion criteria were a past history of asthma , family history of asthma , disability due to coexisting pulmonary or non - pulmonary diseases , and being incapable of understanding the questionnaire . \\n the linguistic validation process in accordance with cultural adaptation involved forward translation of the original english cat to thai ( table s1 ) and northern thai dialect ( table s2 ) versions by the study team and backward translation into english by two native english speakers . \\n one could read and understand thai language whereas the other could speak and understand northern thai dialect well . \\n the process also included two reviewers to verify the appropriate translation of medical terms as well as a pilot test performed in ten patients with copd . \\n both translations had been tested with northern thai patients in chiang mai . to evaluate both versions of cat , we examined their reliability ( internal consistency and reproducibility ) in subjects with copd living in the northern part of thailand , and then tested the validity of the versions by their correlations with sgrq.9 the correlations with modified medical research council scale ( mmrc),10 fev1 , and 6-minute walk distance ( 6-mwd ) were also assessed . \\n patients were randomized to fill one of the two cat versions ( thai or northern thai dialect versions ) , at baseline and between 4 and 12 weeks , to assess reproducibility ( test  retest ) using the same version of questionnaire . \\n the subjects were assessed for post - bronchodilator pulmonary function using a standard spirometer ( spirolab ii and reference values for knudson 1983)11 at baseline visit . on the same day \\n , the patients performed a 6-minute walk test ( 6-mwt ) in accordance with the american thoracic society criteria,12 after which cat , sgrq , and mmrc were administered . \\n the former was estimated by measuring the internal consistency and test  retest reliability of the questionnaires . internal consistency \\n measured the degree of association between the questionnaire items whereas test  retest reliability measured the ability of the questionnaire to produce consistent scores over a short period in stable subjects . \\n the internal consistency of the 8-item questionnaire was measured by applying cronbach s alpha coefficient to cat scores , with values > 0.7 considered acceptable for aggregate data.13 the reproducibility ( test  retest reliability ) of the questionnaire was estimated by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient ( iccc ) for cat between two stable visits . \\n the correlations between cat scores with the other clinical parameters ( mmrc , fev1 , and 6-mwd ) were also analyzed by the same method . \\n we used the following cut - offs : 0<| r |<0.3 , weak correlation ; 0.3<| r |<0.7 , moderate correlation ; and | r |>0.7 , strong correlation.14 student s t - test was used to compare the groups . \\n statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05 and summary results were presented as mean  sd or n ( % ) . \\n all analyses were carried out with the spss statistical package , version 16 for windows . \\n the linguistic validation process in accordance with cultural adaptation involved forward translation of the original english cat to thai ( table s1 ) and northern thai dialect ( table s2 ) versions by the study team and backward translation into english by two native english speakers . \\n one could read and understand thai language whereas the other could speak and understand northern thai dialect

diagnosed with copd from the outpatient chest clinic of chiang mai university hospital were assessed for eligibility during october 2010 to december 2010 . \\n one hundred and sixty stable copd

characteristics among the two groups in terms of sex , age , body mass index ( bmi ) , lung function , quality of life , dyspnea severity , cat score , exercise capacity , gold stage of the disease ,

versions . \\n the test  retest reliability in copd patients of both versions of the questionnaire was equally good at iccc 0.82 and 0.84 for thai and northern thai dialect versions , respectively . \\n the thai version showed moderate correlation whereas the northern thai dialect version showed strong correlation with sgrq ( r=0.60 and 0.77 , p<0.001 , respectively ; figure 2a and b ) . \\n each domain of cat showed significant correlations with those of sgrq ( table 2 ) . \\n symptom domain correlations were moderate for both versions ( r=0.57 and 0.55 , respectively ) . \\n functional and impact domains of the northern thai dialect version showed strong correlation ( r=0.71 and 0.71 , respectively ) , whereas those of the thai version showed moderate correlation only ( r=0.59 and 0.53 , respectively ) ( table 2 ) . \\n both thai and northern thai dialect versions of cat showed negative correlations with fev1 and 6-mwd ( 0.02 and 0.19 ; 0.19 and 0.39 , respectively ) . \\n however , there were moderate correlations with mmrc for both versions of cat ( 0.39 and 0.52 , respectively ) ( table 3 ) . \\n the internal consistency of cat showed a high internal consistency with cronbach

showed high internal consistency that indicated homogeneity existed among the individual items in the questionnaire . \\n our study revealed that both thai and northern thai dialect cat questionnaires had good internal consistency with a cronbach s alpha coefficient of 0.83 and 0.78 , respectively . the good test \\n these findings implied that the two versions of the cat questionnaire were reliable for use with thai copd patients living in northern thailand . \\n the correlation with sgrq was used as a tool to measure the validity of the two thai versions . \\n however , the northern thai dialect version showed a good level of correlation with sgrq whereas the thai version showed only a moderate one . \\n a comparison of each corresponding domain of cat and those of sgrq revealed that the symptom domain of the two versions had the same degree of moderate correlation as with sgrq . \\n however , the remaining two domains ( functional and impact ) of northern thai dialect version had good correlations with sgrq , while the thai version had only moderate correlations . \\n therefore , the higher degree of correlations with the functional and impact domains contributed to better correlation with sgrq for the northern thai dialect version than the thai version . \\n the result indicates that the northern thai dialect version is more suitable than the thai version for evaluating copd in the study population . \\n the reason is likely to be cultural as most of the patients are elderly and familiar with the northern thai dialect using it in their daily life while speaking , writing , and reading . \\n therefore , their comprehension of the items in the northern thai dialect version could be much better than that in the thai version . \\n we suggest that the dialect version should be validated for use in copd patients familiar with their local dialect . \\n although cat is not a diagnostic tool , it can identify the health impairment of copd patients and is shown to have better correlation with disease progression.15 earlier studies have reported that multiple consequences of copd have no relationship with airflow limitation and fev1 can not reflect the total impairment caused by the disease . \\n these findings confirm that fev1 is a relatively poor correlate of symptoms such as breathlessness and health status of copd patients.16 in contrary , mmrc functional dyspnea with moderate correlations has proven to be a better parameter in predicting outcomes in patients with copd as in earlier studies1 and should be recommended in the routine evaluation of these patients . \\n the 6-mwd , a parameter that provides reproducible data in the assessment of functional status,17 has contradictory results in this study as it shows poor correlation for the thai version and moderate correlation for the northern thai dialect version . \\n firstly , the results of our findings may not be generalized for all the gold severity stages and age groups because most of our subjects were in gold stages ii  iii and elderly . \\n secondly , most of our findings are based on data from a single center only and might not be reliably extrapolated to the entire northern region . \\n however , it is well - known that cat has very similar discriminative properties compared to the more complex sgrq , proving that it could become a standard procedure to measure the impact of copd on a patient s health.7 although the cat questionnaire showed very similar property compared to the more complex sgrq , it could not be recommended to be used in making important decisions about individuals.18 however , cat could play a supporting role in supplementing information obtained from lung function measurement and assessment of exacerbation risk.7 \\n the two thai - versions of cat were proved to be reliable and valid tools for assessing the quality of life in copd patients . \\n the northern thai dialect version is found to be more suitable than the thai dialect version for evaluating copd patients living in the northern part of thailand . \\n the result of this study raises the awareness of the influence of regional dialect on the validity of cat for ensuring clear communication with copd patients in the same country . \\n \",\n          \"until recently , warfarin had been one of the only treatment options for long - term anticoagulation of patients requiring chronic oral anticoagulation . in the last few years , a number of new oral anticoagulant agents , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , and edoxaban , have been studied and approved for prevention of stroke in non - valvular atrial fibrillation ( af ) and treatment or prevention of venous thromboembolism ( vte ) . however , many unresolved questions remain on how to optimally use these drugs in specific clinical situations such as those with chronic kidney disease and hepatic insufficiency , and in those taking drugs that can inhibit cytochrome p450 ( cyp)-3a4 . \\n furthermore , practical concerns have been raised about the lack of a reversal agent for any of these three new agents . \\n consequently , warfarin will likely remain an important therapeutic option for the primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic events for a variety of medical conditions for many patients.1,2 warfarin works by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin - k dependent clotting factors ii , vii , ix , and x as well as the anticoagulant factors , proteins c and s. it is a difficult drug to dose because many factors are incompletely understood that influence an individual s response.1,2 it is also a complex drug because of its narrow therapeutic window , with even a mild degree of over - anticoagulation potentially leading to hemorrhagic complications.3 these limitations necessitate the close monitoring of the international normalized ratio ( inr ) , which is both resource intensive and inconvenient . \\n warfarin s pronounced inter - individual variability in dose requirements and its complicated management has led to numerous studies evaluating different potential predictors of warfarin requirements , including age , sex , nutritional status , presence of comorbid conditions , concomitant medications , and vitamin k intake.2,4 the objective of our study was to examine the potential effect of age and sex on warfarin maintenance dose in ambulatory adult patients . \\n we conducted a retrospective study at a long - term outpatient anticoagulation clinic ( celebration health , florida hospital ) . \\n patients are scheduled for 20 minute office visits during which an instant finger - stick inr is obtained using coaguchek s ( hoffman - la roche ltd , basel , switzerland ) . \\n the clinical pharmacists subsequently provide the patient with dosing instructions and may renew prescriptions for warfarin and low - molecular - weight heparins on behalf of the patients enrolling physicians , as part of a collaborative - practice agreement . \\n patients leave each visit with their instant inr results , dosing regimen , and next scheduled follow - up appointment . \\n the medical records of all patients actively enrolled at the clinic from 20072009 were randomly selected for review . \\n inclusion criteria were patients with af or vte on warfarin with an inr range of 23 ; patients stabilized on warfarin therapy ( reflected by two consecutive therapeutic inr at the same total weekly dose [ twd ] ) ; non - smokers ; patients with no to moderate alcohol consumption ( 2 drinks per day ) . to control for confounders , we excluded patients who were anticoagulated for other indications , smokers , heavy alcohol consumers ( more than two drinks per day ) , and patients on drugs with major interactions with warfarin as identified by the drug information handbook ( 17th edition).5 the twd of warfarin was calculated for each patient . \\n the following data were also collected : indication for warfarin , sex , age ( divided into eight groups ; group one : 2029 years , group two : 3039 years , group three : 4049 years , group four : 5059 years , group five : 6069 years , group six : 7079 years , group seven : 8089 years , group eight : 90 years or above ) , alcohol consumption , and the patient s medication list ( including prescription and over the counter medications ) . \\n to detect a possible difference in the twd between the sexes , we used the student s t - test . to assess the impact of age , we used analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by a bonferroni post hoc test . \\n chicago , il , usa ) with the a priori level of significance set at a p - value of 0.05 or less . \\n a review of 340 medical records was concluded , of which 96 patients met the inclusion criteria . \\n the mean twd ( mg )  standard deviation ( sd ) was 39.4414.21 for men and 36.1515.43 for women \\n a statistically significant lower mean twd was seen in patients in the 8089 age group as compared to patients in 2029 , 3039 , 4049 , and 5059 age groups ( p<0.05 ) . \\n mean twd of patients in group 2029 , 3039 , and 4049 was around 51 mg as compared to almost half , 24.82 mg , in group 8089 ( p<0.05 ) as shown in table 3 . \\n when initiated , it is associated with either a high incidence of over - anticoagulation which leads to bleeding or persistent subtherapeutic inr that not only prolongs the period of thrombotic risk , but potentially increases costs because of subsequent adjunctive use of other parenteral anticoagulants . \\n it is hard to make accurate dose prediction due to the inability to take inter - individual and intra - individual variability in response to the drug into account . \\n the present study found a significant association between increasing age and a reduced maintenance dosage of warfarin . \\n the twd for patients 8089 years of age was 24.82 mg , which was almost half the twd for groups aged between 2059 years ( mean twd for the four age groups = 49.18 mg ) . \\n a simple clinical approach to starting warfarin therapy in patients between ages 8089 without an acute event would be to initiate daily doses reflective of 25 mg per week . \\n these findings confirm previously published literature ; warfarin dose for maintenance therapy is inversely proportional to age.612 patients 90 years ( group eight ) received a twd that was lower than groups one , two , three , four , and five ( 28.5 mg versus an average of 49.18 mg ) but this difference was not statistically significant . \\n this may be explained by the small number of patients in group eight ( only two patients ) . \\n our study adds to the body of evidence supporting warfarin dosing adjustments in the elderly . \\n data published by garcia et al suggested that as patients age , the twd declines by 0.4 mg per year of life.13 the mechanism for increased sensitivity to warfarin with aging is not well - understood . \\n in general , the elderly have decreased serum proteins , metabolic activities , and renal excretion.14 these alterations lead to differences in the pharmacokinetics of a drug that increases the persistence of the drug in the body , and consequently , increased sensitivity to the drug is observed among the elderly . \\n however , a previous report has revealed that there was no appreciable difference in the pharmacokinetics of warfarin , ie , the plasma half - life , apparent volume of distribution , plasma clearance , and plasma warfarin metabolite levels , between younger ( age range 2040 ; mean , 25 years ) and older ( age range , 6594 ; mean , 82 years ) patients.15 this suggests that pharmacokinetic factors did not influence the age - dependent increase in the sensitivity to warfarin . \\n a negative correlation between age and hepatic drug - metabolizing enzymes has been detected in rat models in vitro , and a study of hepatic microsomal enzymes in humans showed a 30% decline in hepatic drug metabolism and cytochrome p450 content with age.1618 others have suggested an age - related decrease in the diffusion of oxygen within the hepatocyte that compromises the oxygen - dependent mixed - function oxidase enzymes.19 changes in hepatic glutathione levels and decreased activity of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate - dependent reductase of vitamin k are other postulated hypotheses.20 several studies,7,10,21 but not all,8,2224 report that sex is a determinant of warfarin dose ; women require lower doses than men . \\n however , in our study , although women required a 3.29 mg lower twd than men , the difference was not statistically significant . because all patients were managed in the same anticoagulation clinic with the same anticoagulation monitor , the variability resulting from different management strategies and testing methods was controlled . \\n we had a relatively small sample size , which means that this study may not have been adequately powered to detect a statistically significant difference between patient - specific factors , if a true difference did exist . \\n it was not feasible to control for all confounders , they were limited to the extent possible by excluding smokers , heavy alcohol consumers , and patients on any drug that interacts extensively with warfarin . \\n although we attempted to account for as many confounding factors as possible we did not gather information on the patients diet , compliance with anticoagulant drug therapy , and changes in health status . \\n however , since our data were from stable patients , and since the inrs did not vary , we do not believe that any changes in these variables were significant enough to affect anticoagulation control . \\n the accuracy of our study would have been improved by the inclusion of information on genetic polymorphisms since polymorphisms of the vitamin k epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 gene ( vkorc1 ) and the cyp2c9 gene are important determinants of warfarin dosing . \\n we did not include information on genetic polymorphism due to the difficulty and the questionable utility of performing genetic evaluation in the clinical setting . \\n many clinicians believe that a genetic - based dosing scheme is unlikely to result in a practical advantage because of several reasons , including timely access to genotyping , which might result in unnecessary treatment delays and subsequent prolongation of the parenteral anticoagulation , increased costs , and inability of genetic - based models to account for environmental factors . \\n furthermore , dosing adjustments continue to be based on inr values that could be considered a surrogate marker of genetic information . \\n this study found that mean warfarin doses declined predictably with age and were not affected by sex . although it did appear that women required a smaller twd than men , the difference was not statistically significant . \\n these observations suggest that the current initiation and maintenance doses should be modified to reduce the risk of inadequate therapy in young patients and excessive anticoagulation in the elderly .\",\n          \"single cloacal swabs were collected from apparently healthy ducks at 56 sites within 6 geographic regions : british columbia , alberta , manitoba , ontario , qubec , and the atlantic

and hospitalization with a postoperative mortality rate of 1.7% to 4.2% in  elective  cases and 16% to 17.5% in  urgent  cases.37 transbronchial lung cryobiopsy ( tblc ) has been introduced in recent years to establish the diagnosis of ild . the size of the biopsy specimen obtained from tblc is significantly larger than that obtained through conventional transbronchial biopsy with preserved histopathology.8,9 the procedural technique varies among institutions , ranging from using the flexible bronchoscope with conscious sedation to using the rigid bronchoscope with fogarty balloon under

laboratory data , radiographic data , procedure , anesthesia and pathology reports , and complications . this is in line with other reports.9,12 given the retrospective nature of our study , the calculated average anesthesia time for all cases was 100.41 minutes . as patients with sufficient clinical and radiographic features to be diagnosed with a certain ild were not referred for biopsy , we believe the diagnosis by histopathology from our study was slightly different from previous reports .\",\n          \"to better understand the effects of this cumulative disadvantage and ultimately improve the delivery of care , specifically in the context of sle , we propose that such approaches are necessary to improve care for sle patients , particularly for those at highest risk . grounded in sdh frameworks and the ccm , this paper presents issues relative to accessibility to suggest that more transdisciplinary research focused on the role of place could improve care for sle patients , particularly the most vulnerable patients . complementing an sdh framework , wagner 's chronic care model [ 50 , 51 ] ( ccm ) is a widely accepted model for understanding how to best organize the delivery of care to improve patient health outcomes , through six interrelated system changes that aim to make care more patient - centered and oriented around evidence - based practices ( see figure 1 ) . over the past 25 years , research has demonstrated the effectiveness of arthritis self - management education delivered by small - group , home study , computer , and internet modalities [ 36 , 5672 ] . accessibility to care is an important component in understanding the influence of social determinants of health , and it has been addressed in health service policy research for several years [ 93 , 94 ] . medicaid patients were also more likely to be seen by a general practitioner or in the emergency room ( er ) for sle complications ; travel impediments to accessing rheumatologists could have contributed to this statistic . thus , drawing from geography research methods and theories , researchers attempting to better understand place - related disparities could benefit greatly from transdisciplinary intervention activities that include research areas that explore the impact of travel on sle patients , especially considering the geographic coverage of clinical trials studying sle

        "these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] .\n",
        "although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time\n",
        ", chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention .\n",
        "recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety ,\n",
        "for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety .\n",
        "it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance .\n",
        "anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses .\n",
        "this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study .\n",
        "noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd .\n",
        "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] .\n",
        "overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology .\n",
        "future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related ,\n",
        "future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients .\n",
        "research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms .\n",
        "future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients .\n",
        "previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits .\n",
        "for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology .\n",
        "thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial .\n",
        "it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety .\n",
        "results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety .\n",
        "although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically .\n",
        "recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings .\n",
        "based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain .\n",
        "future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd .\n",
        "another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study .\n",
        "future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd .\n",
        "one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression .\n",
        "although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads .\n",
        "controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work .\n",
        "considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd .\n",
        "anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options .\n",
